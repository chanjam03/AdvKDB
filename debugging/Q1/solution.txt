Problem:

    1. The below tickerplant log contains and error.
        a) Locate the error
        b) Fix the error
    Show how each was performed.

Solution:

    To begin we can read in the tplog into a q session (started in log directory)
    with get `:tplog and set to instance variable msg.

        q) msg:get `:tplog

    Looking through the tplog contents I can identify the following errors: 

        1. sym entries are type chars not symbols for entry 3 and 10
            q) show msg 2 9
        2. the 7th entry is broken up into 3 distinct lines
            q) show msg 6 7 8
        3. The size column in the 5th entry is incorrect type
            q) show msg[4;2] `size

    Should be able to fix all these issues with just a single command: 

        q) `:tplog_fixed set .[3 cut raze get `:tplog; (::;2); {update `$sym, "F"$price, "I"$size from string[x]} each]

    Looking back at the problem areas, issues are now fixed.
